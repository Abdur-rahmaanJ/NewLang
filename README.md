# NewLang
Creating a new programming language, slowly

So far you can: add, subtract, multiply, divide, floor divide, take something to the power of something else, store variables (which, as of now, do not store across lines, sorry), print things.

No strings yet, too simple for that though it will be one of the next things I do.

Create a file called test.txt in the same folder as the file, add some numbers in postfix order, and it will do all the math for you.

# Examples:

1 2 + will return 3

1 2 - is 1

2 1 - is -1

(Note: every operation or number must have a space between it because of the way I'm reading the strings)

"2 var =" will store a variable called "var" with the value of 2

"2 var = 2 + print" will print out 4
